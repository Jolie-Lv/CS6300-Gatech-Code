# **Project Plan -- Team 01**

##1 Introduction 

		
 > Team01 is tasked with developing software to produce the average number of words per sentence in a given file. 	This application will be used by students in a classroom environment. 
	

##2 Process Description


**1. Project Planning**

 > The process in which our team outlines the activities needed to complete the project, the order in which they should be completed, and estimates time required to complete the project.  Activities are summarized, and entrance and exit criteria are defined for each activity. After this stage, the team should have a completed Project Plan.

- *Entrance criteria*: 
	- Project Plan template 
	- Development team
- *Exit criteria*: 
	- Completed Project Plan 
	- Defined development team roles


**2. Requirements Gathering**

 > The process in which our team determines critical functionality and features from stakeholder requirements and needs. After requirements gathering, the developers should have enough information to develop the specified system.

- *Entrance criteria*: 
	- Project Plan 
	- Stakeholder interview 
	- Technical specifications from P1L5
	- Requirements document template
- *Exit criteria*: 
	- Completed Requirements Document


**3. Development**

 > The process in which our team designs and builds a functional program from the requirements specified in the Requirements  Document. After development, the team should have a working prototype of the system.

- *Entrance criteria*: 
	- Requirements Document
- *Exit criteria*: 
	- Code for the completed prototype


**4. Testing and Refactoring**

 > The process in which our team writes test cases for the developed prototype. The test cases should cover the smallest possible units of functionality.  If the tests reveal any bugs in the code, then the code should also be refactored 
to eliminate these bugs. After this stage, the team should have a full set of test cases for the program.

- *Entrance criteria*: 
	- Prototype Code 
- *Exit criteria*: 
	- Test Cases 
	- Refactored Code


**5. Documentation**

 > The process in which our team creates documentation that should sufficiently inform users on how to operate our program. 
The documentation should be easy to understand, so that users of any technical level will be able to consult with it should 
they have any questions about how to use the system. After this stage, the team should have a completed User Documentation 
that acts as a manual for the program.

- *Entrance criteria*: 
	- Refactored Code 
- *Exit criteria*: 
	- User Documentation
