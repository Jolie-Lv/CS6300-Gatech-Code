# **Critique of Ryan's Design**

##1 Namit's comments 

- *Pros*: 
	- Easy to follow and clean interface
- *Cons*: 
	- The design should follow the policy of 'what' instead of 'how' - too much detail for a class diagram

##2 Alex's comments 

- *Pros*: 
	- The way the classes interact makes sense to me
	- A lot of good implementation details
- *Cons*: 
	- Possibly too much detail for a design?
	- Do we need the item class? Seems outside of scope

- *Cons*: 
	- Greater level of detail than required (id's / items)
	- Missing utility classes found in professor's examples

- *Pros*: 
	- card processor as an assoc class for the transaction is good
	- good clean method detail
- *Cons*: 
	- i think the rewards should be broken down
	- hard to follow the path
