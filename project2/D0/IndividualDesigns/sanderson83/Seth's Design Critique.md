# **Critique of Seth's Design**

##1 Alex's comments 

- *Pros*: 
	- Very simple, easy to quickly understand
	- Relationships make sense, seems like all essential classes are there
- *Cons*: 
	- Might want a StallManager class for adding/editing customers

##2 Ryan's comments 

- *Pros*: 
	- Simple and very easy to see what's happening, I had trouble with that
	- I think the level of detail might be what we're actually supposed to have
- *Cons*: 
	- It's now how I see the classes interacting (that's just an opinion).
	- I'm not sure all of the functionality is accounted for

- *Pros*: 
	- Simple
- *Cons*: 
	- Needs a few more methods to account for all functionality
	- confused between goldStatusDiscount and Reward
	
##4 Namit's comments 

- *Pros*: 
	- Very easy to follow and not complicated for a UML diagram
- *Cons*: 
	- It would be nice to have a stallmanager class which acts as a user interface class.
