# **Critique of Alex's Design**

##1 Namit's comments 

- *Pros*: 
	- Concise and easy to understand
- *Cons*: 
	- Credit card could be an association to the customer or transaction

##2 Ryan's comments 

- *Pros*: 
	- Very  clean and easy to read, flows well.
	- I wish I could have done a better job labeling my relationships. We need to keep this piece for the group project
- *Cons*: 
	- I don't think we need a class for the mailer. It's just an operation IMO
	- A couple of the links look odd, like mailer to payments, wouldn't the processedTransaction method just check that (the different discount checks) and do the mailing?
	
##3 Hunter's comments 

- *Pros*: 
	- Better than mine IMO
	- Very appropriate level of detail per the intructors example
	- clear / easy to follow
- *Cons*: 
	- transaction should probably be labeled as an aggregation / 1 to many relationship?
	
##4 Seth's comments 

- *Pros*: 
	- Very thorough and clean
	- Flow makes sense
- *Cons*: 
	- I think it could be broken down a bit. Some of the classes aren't needed and methods are definitive but too complex
	- I think the credit card should be more of an association of the transaction
	- confused by the two transaction methods in customer and transaction
