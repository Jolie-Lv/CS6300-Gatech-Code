# **Project Plan -- Team 01**

## 1 Introduction

> Team01 is tasked with developing PReMS, an Android application that implements a payment and rewards management system for 
 mobile stalls. This application will be used commonly at farmer's market stalls.

## 2 Process Description


**1. Software Design**

 > The process in which our team compares individual UML software architecture designs to create a final software design for the application.  
 Designs are compared, critiqued, and refined.

- *Entrance criteria*: 
	- Individual UML design drafts
- *Exit criteria*: 
	- Final software design


**2. Inception and Elaboration**

 > The process in which our team, using our Software Design and Requirements, creates an initial set of detailed documents outlining several 
 of the specific design and implementation details of our system.

- *Entrance criteria*: 
	- Final software design
	- Requirements
	- Documentation templates
- *Exit criteria*: 
	- Initial drafts of documentation including:
		- Project plan
		- Vision document
		- Use-case model  
		- Supplementary requirements
		- Design document
		- Test plan without results


**3. Construction**

 > The process in which our team designs and builds a functional product from the documentation/specifications created in the Inception and Elaboration phase. 
 After construction, the team should have a working software product integrated on adequate platforms.

- *Entrance criteria*: 
	- Initial drafts of documentation
- *Exit criteria*: 
	- Second drafts of documentation
	- Traceability information of select use cases 
	- Initial beta version of the application
	- Test plan with partial results
	- User manual
	
	


**4. Transition**

 > The process in which our team addresses issues discovered by users of our application, and performs maintenance in order 
 to remove bugs or add final touches/features to the system.

- *Entrance criteria*: 
	- Beta version of application
	- Second drafts of documentation
- *Exit criteria*: 
	- Final version of application
	- Final draft of documentation
	- Product in use
