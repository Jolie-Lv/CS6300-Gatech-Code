## 1 Introduction

PReMS is an mobile Android application that will let farmers process credit card transactions and reward their most loyal customers with discounts. It is intended for use by farmers who need to track transactions and build brand loyalty through rewards at local farmers markets.

## 2 Business Needs/Requirements

In todayâ€™s economy, independent farmers increasingly find a need to drive income and build brand loyalty by establishing mobile stalls at local farmers markets. Currently, people involved in farmers markets have no good way to process real-time credit card payments and manage rewards in a mobile environment.  Over the last decade there have been huge strides in mobile technology. The millennial generation desires fast simple transactions and personalized reward programs.

In order to most effectively leverage their growing customer base and stay ahead of the curve, these farmers need to know who are their most loyal customers.  If they fail to recognize their best customers, they risk losing them to more competitive farmers' stalls and alienating their base.

These farmers need a way to monitor accurate, up-to-the-minute information about their customers and their transactions so that they can proactively make decisions, optimize their business processes, and solidify their presence in the customer's mind.

## 3 Product / Solution Overview

PReMS is a mobile Android application that will let farmers reward their most loyal customers with discounts.  It will process credit transactions in real-time, track customer history, and automatically apply reward based discounts.

The application will be designed specifically for farmers who need to track transactions in a mobile environment.  It will allow farmers to add and edit customers, keep track of payments, and manage rewards all in simple optimized fashion.

## 4 Major Features

* **Manage Real-Time Mobile Purchases** - The system will need to process credit card payments using a provided credit card scanner and secure payment-processing service provider.  The system will need to display a list of purchases for any customer.  The system will need to display the date, amount, and discount from any individual purchase.
* **Manage Rewards** - The system will need to track purchase of $100 or more and apply a $10 discounts on future purchases for each transaction above the $100 threshold.  The system will need to track customers who spend $1,000 or more in a calendar year and award them "gold" status, which entitles them to a 5% discount for life.
* **Send Reward Notifications** - The system will need to email customers every time they receive a reward and when they reach "gold" status.

## 5 Scope and Limitations

The initial version of PReMS will focus on providing information to the farmers only, and will have a set of features designed to appeal to the seller, but not to customers/consumers.  In particular, this means that the software will not have features for the general consumer, such as:

* The ability to look up ones own transactions
* The ability to look up ones own reward status

The software will be limited to support on Android devices.
